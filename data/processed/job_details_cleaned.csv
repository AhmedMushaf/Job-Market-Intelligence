Legal Data & Contract Intelligence Analyst (Legal Data & AI),Wilbert Funeral Services,Bangalore/Bengaluru,4 - 7 years,Contract draftingmetadataHelpdeskSenior AnalystLegalPackagingOperationsAnalyticsPythontext analytics,1 week ago,38,"Legal Data & Contract Intelligence Analyst (Legal Data & AI) Wilbert Funeral Services Hubli, Mangaluru, Mysuru, Bengaluru, Belgaum Marmon Technologies India Private Limited As a part of the global industrial organization Marmon Holdings which is backed by Berkshire Hathaway you ll be doing things that matter, leading at every level, and winning a better way. We re committed to making a positive impact on the world, providing you with diverse learning and working opportunities, and fostering a culture where everyone s empowered to be their best. This role extracts and synthesizes clause -level redline patterns from Marmon templates and historical negotiations. Deliverables center on structured intelligence variant clusters, exception frequency, edit rationales, and drift over time to inform contract SMEs and future playbook authors. The role does not draft fallback language or determine legal positions; it provides the evidence and pattern clarity required for those decisions. Secondary Function (as bandwidth allows): Beyond contract -pattern analytics, this role may support adjacent legal data initiatives using the same core skillset (text analytics, trend detection, pattern clustering). Examples include matter - volume trends, help -desk inquiry grouping, metadata normalization, and other structured insight work that benefits from pattern analysis, not legal decision-making. This role does not draft playbooks, define fallback positions, or configure AI/CLM rule logic. ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS: Redline Pattern Extraction & Variant Discovery Analyze historical tracked changes and markups at scale to identify recurring edit patterns, counterparty tendencies, and structured clause -variation clusters in legal text. Group similar edits into normalized variant sets without determining fallback positions or legal acceptability. Clause Change Clustering & Exception Mapping Classify edits by frequency, type (add / delete / narrow / broaden), and location in the document. Surface anomalies and outliers for legal SME review, not interpretation. LLM -Assisted Summarization & Tagging Use AI tools to accelerate classification of edit intent and theme categorization while maintaining analyst oversight and QC. Feed structured outputs to legal SMEs; no drafting or position -setting. Insight Packaging for SMEs & Playbook Authors Produce clean variant summaries, drift reports, and exception trend snapshots to support SME decision-making (not authoring). Deliver contract -type-specific insight packs (e.g., 200 500 agreements) summarizing top recurring edits, variant clusters, exception patterns, and drift. Present structured findings to SMEs who determine final positions. Scalable Text Extraction & Data Normalization Use Python -based scripts and approved AI services to support extraction, normalization, and clustering at scale (operate/iterate, not architect). Extract previous text vs revised language across batches of Word documents. Treat redlines as structured text elements, not legal judgments. Secondary Analytics (As Bandwidth Allows) Support adjacent analytics initiatives (e.g., help-desk patterning, matter trend clustering, metadata normalization) using the same text -pattern skillset. Strictly analytics, no contract drafting, negotiation, or rule design. Cross-Time -Zone Collaboration Provide clear async updates, backlog transparency, and pattern summaries to US-based legal stakeholders. Bachelor s degree (B.Tech / B. E / B.Sc. / BCom / BA or LL. B). Postgrad in Analytics, Data, Legal Ops optional, not required. 4 7 years in data/document analytics; exposure to legal text formats helpful. No drafting, negotiation, or fallback expertise required. (operate, not architect). Ability to treat legal language as structured text (not interpretive meaning). Comfortable extracting & grouping tracked changes at scale. Accuracy mindset for clustering and outlier surfacing. Strong communication skills to present findings to SMEs for legal interpretation.
